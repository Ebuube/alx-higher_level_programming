# Object Relational Mapping
In this project, you will look into tow amazing worlds: Databases and Python!

In the first part, you will use the module `MySQLdb` to connect to a MySQL database and execute your SQL queries.

In the second part, you will use the module `SQLALchemy` an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).

The biggest difference is no more SQL queries! Indeed, the purpose of an ORM is to abstract the storage to the usage.
