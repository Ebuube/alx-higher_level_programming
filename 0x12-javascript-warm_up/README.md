# JavaScript Warm Up
JavaScript is used for many things. Here, you will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:

 * Scripting (same as we did with Python)
 * Web front-end

For the moment, and for learning all basic concepts of this language, we will do some scripting. After, we will make our AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery.

## 0. First constant, first print

Write a script that prints “JavaScript is amazing”:

 * You must create a constant variable called `myVar` with the value “JavaScript is amazing”
 * You must use `console.log(...)` to print all output
 * You are not allowed to use `var`

## 1. 3 languages

Write a script that prints 3 lines:

* The first line: “C is fun”
* The second line: “Python is cool”
* The third line: “JavaScript is amazing”
* You must use `console.log(...)` to print all output
* You are not allowed to use `var`

## 2. Arguments

Write a script that prints a message depending of the number of arguments passed:

* If no arguments are passed to the script, print “No argument”
* If only one argument is passed to the script, print “Argument found”
* Otherwise, print “Arguments found”
* You must use `console.log(...)` to print all output
* You are not allowed to use `var`

## 3. Value of my argument

Write a script that prints the first argument passed to it:

* If no arguments are passed to the script, print “No argument”
* You must use `console.log(...)` to print all output
* You are not allowed to use `var`
* You are not allowed to use `length`

## 4. Create a sentence

Write a script that prints two arguments passed to it, in the following format: “ is ”

* You must use `console.log(...)` to print all output
* You are not allowed to use `var`

## An Integer

Write a script that prints `My number: <first argument converted in integer>` if the first argument can be converted to an integer:

* If the argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Not a number”
* You must use `console.log(...)` to print all output
* You are not allowed to use `var`
* You are not allowed to use `try/catch`

## 6 Loop to languages

Write a script that prints 3 lines: (like `1-multi_languages.js`) but by using an array of string and a loop

The first line: “C is fun”
The second line: “Python is cool”
The third line: “JavaScript is amazing”
You must use `console.log(...)` to print all output
You are not allowed to use `var`
You are not allowed to use any `if/else` statement
You can use only one `console.log`
You must use a loop (`while`, `for`, etc.)

## 7 I love C

Write a script that prints x times “C is fun”

* Where `x` is the first argument of the script
* If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Missing number of occurrences”
* You must use `console.log(...)` to print all output
* You are not allowed to use `var`
* You can use only two `console.log`
* You must use a loop (`while`, `for`, etc.)
