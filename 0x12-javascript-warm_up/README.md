# JavaScript Warm Up
JavaScript is used for many things. Here, you will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:

 * Scripting (same as we did with Python)
 * Web front-end

For the moment, and for learning all basic concepts of this language, we will do some scripting. After, we will make our AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery.

## 0. First constant, first print

Write a script that prints “JavaScript is amazing”:

 * You must create a constant variable called `myVar` with the value “JavaScript is amazing”
 * You must use `console.log(...)` to print all output
 * You are not allowed to use `var`

## 1. 3 languages

Write a script that prints 3 lines:

* The first line: “C is fun”
* The second line: “Python is cool”
* The third line: “JavaScript is amazing”
* You must use `console.log(...)` to print all output
* You are not allowed to use `var`

## 2. Arguments

Write a script that prints a message depending of the number of arguments passed:

* If no arguments are passed to the script, print “No argument”
* If only one argument is passed to the script, print “Argument found”
* Otherwise, print “Arguments found”
* You must use `console.log(...)` to print all output
* You are not allowed to use `var`

## 3. Value of my argument

Write a script that prints the first argument passed to it:

* If no arguments are passed to the script, print “No argument”
* You must use `console.log(...)` to print all output
* You are not allowed to use `var`
* You are not allowed to use `length`
